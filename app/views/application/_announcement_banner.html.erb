      <h3>Asset Index Belongs to the Community</h3>

      <p>Asset Index belongs to the community. While Chef has the responsibility to keep it running and be stewards of its functionality, what it does and how it works is driven by the community. The <a href="https://github.com/sensu/bonsai-asset-index">sensu/bonsai-asset-index</a> repository will continue to be where development of the Asset Index application takes place. Come be part of shaping the direction of Asset Index by opening issues and pull requests or by joining us on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bonsai-asset-index">Asset Index mailing list</a> or in <a href="https://gitter.im/sensu/bonsai-asset-index">Gitter</a>.</p>
